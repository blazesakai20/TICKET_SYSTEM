Steps to run the project in local machine.:

Step 1: Download and Install XAMPP.

Step 2: Clone/Copy this github repository and paste it in xampp/htdocs folder.

Step 3: In localhost/phpmyadmin create a new database train.

Step 4: Import train.sql file from the project folder to train database in localhost/phpmyadmin.

Regarding deployment of project on AWS: Iâ€™ll suggest you to use a windows instance instead of linux instance for hosting as you will get GUI Access and the process will be easier. There are plenty of videos regarding that on youtube.

IMP Note: If you are creating any Instances, Delete all the instances / configurations you have created in AWS once you are done with the implementation. Amazon charges an exorbitant amount after a particular threshold limit is crossed for a free tier account.

*Note: My AWS free tier subscription has expired so I have removed AWS SES and SNS script from the project files
